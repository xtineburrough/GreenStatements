    <div class="about">
         <p>Green Statements is a project made by LabSynthE, directed by xtine burrough with creative researchers Cynthia O'Neill and Cansu Simsek.</p>

<p>         The corporate world is full of mission statements about goals, people, products, services, about commitments to diversity and of course, about sustainability initiatives.
    The problem is that these statements have lost their impact, and this loss spreads like a virus. When companies—especially large, visible companies—don't behave in alignment with their statements, the public assumes that sustainability statements do not reflect authentic goals. Companies lose their credibility.

    <p>    We are media artists. We are three trickster women. We collaborate in a laboratory that investigates synthetic and electronic poetry.
        This project intervenes in the language of corporate green statements.
        Through our project we become watchdogs of sustainability statements while simultaneously offering statements that any company can use in their corporate communications.</p>

    <p>   We are inspired by two works of media art: Josh On's They Rule performed an online panopticon, laying bare the people who held the most power through their CEO positions in global corporations.
        More recently, Ben Grosser's <a href = "https://bengrosser.com/projects/endless-doomscroller/" title = "Endless Doomscroller" alt = "Endless">The Endless Doomscroller</a>  performs the never-ending act of scrolling through bad news headlines.
        Our project, too, is an infinite scroll. Instead of scrolling for bad news, though, or keeping tabs on corporate positions, we offer a scroll of corporate language used in sustainability statements from around the globe.
        Half of our quotes are tagged with their authors—in this way we hold accountable the companies that promise to protect the planet with their green statements. Half of the quotes we share were written by us—a mash-up of language we encountered while researching this project. These appear as being attributed to "Your Company Name Here." We offer these statements for anyone to use.
    </p>
    <p>If you have language we should include: statements from corporations or statements you would like to see corporations use, please <a href = "https://forms.gle/7StKHCm1gdETCefZ7" title = "Google Form" alt = "Add Statements" target="_blank">share it!</a></p>
