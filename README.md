# GreenStatements
This project enacts a media arts watchdog of sustainability statements while simultaneously offering statements that any company can use in their corporate communications.

The corporate world is full of mission statements about goals, people, products, services, about commitments to diversity and of course, about sustainability initiatives. The problem is that these statements have lost their impact, and this loss spreads like a virus. When companies—especially large, visible companies—don't behave in alignment with their statements, the public assumes that sustainability statements do not reflect authentic goals. Companies lose their credibility.

This project enacts a media arts watchdog of sustainability statements while simultaneously offering statements that any company can use in their corporate communications. Designed as an infinite scroll, we offer seemingly never-ending corporate language used in sustainability statements from around the globe. Half of our quotes are tagged with their authors—in this way we hold accountable the companies that promise to protect the planet with their green statements. Half of the quotes we share were written by us—a mash-up of language we encountered while researching this project. These appear as being attributed to “Your Company Name Here.” We offer these statements for anyone to use. If you have language we should include, either statements from corporations or statements you would like to see corporations use, please share it using the link on our site!

Green Statements is an interactive project made by LabSynthE, directed by xtine burrough with creative researchers Cynthia O'Neill and Cansu Simsek.
